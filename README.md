# APN-Fix
A simple Magisk module that fixes empty APN settings

No APN settings appear and therefore you can't use mobile data unless you add the settings manually?

This Magisk module will solve this problem.  Once the device is installed and rebooted, go to the APN settings and select the "Reset" option to load the settings.

## Don't use this module if you don't have this problem.
